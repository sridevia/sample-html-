<h3><a name="reception"></a>Critical reception</h3>
<p>Idlebrain gave a 3.5/5 rating and mentioned "Mahesh Babu's performance in Pokiri itself is worth your ticket and the rest is bonus!".[10] Sify wrote "Pokiri is made to showcase Mahesh Babu's heroism and it works to a large extent. He is fantastic and the superbly choreographed action scenes in a local train by fight master Vijayan and the shoot-out in the ruins are fantastic. The highlight is Mahesh Babu who looks cool, hip and is in complete control. Ileana is there for glamour and she is promising".The film was released on 28 April 2006.
